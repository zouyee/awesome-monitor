`awesome-monitor` is a hand-crafted list for high-quality information about monitor ecosystem and  its resources. I don't constraint to monitor  only resources, so feel free to add other resources about container or deployment in general. It would be nice if it is related or compatible with monitor ecosystem in some way. But if it's awesome, OK!

- Each item should be limited to one link
- The link should be the name of the package or project or website
- Descriptions should be clear and concise (read it out loud to be sure)
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line
- if you want to add more than one link, please don't do all PR on the exact same line, it usually results in conflicts and your PR cannot be automatically merged...

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To be on the list, it would be *nice* if entries adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Clearly stating when a entry is relating to monitor ecosystem
- Clearly "what is it" --> which category it belongs : paper, tools, structure, video, twitter account, website and so on.
- Clearly stating "what is it for": mention the problem it solves. Just try your best, make it clear for the next person.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
